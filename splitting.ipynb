    "# Splitting a string without spaces into words\n",
    "Certain languages, such as Thai or classical Latin, do not use spaces to separate words within sentences. This creates some challenges to text-processing software that has to handle words. Given a sentence recorded as a string without spaces and a dictionary (a list of words), split the sentence into words. In case multiple results are possible, return any of them."
